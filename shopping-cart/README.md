This project took me around 3 weeks. I was busy a lot and didn't have time for the project but now it's somewhat finished. It is at the final version. Still there are some minor bugs which I need to fix tho. This website is very responsive and 
it was fun doing this project. Learned a lot about react-router-dom and also learned other things like Link, Navlink Router, Routes, etc.
